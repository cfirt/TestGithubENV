# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: echo 1
        run: echo ${BOOST_ROOT_1_72_0}

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: echo 2
        run: |
          BBBB=bbb
          BOOST_ROOT=${BOOST_ROOT_1_72_0}
          echo \"${BOOST_ROOT} ${BBBB} cccc\"
        
      - name: echo 3
        run: BOOST_ROOT={{ env.BOOST_ROOT_1_72_0 }} echo ${BOOST_ROOT}
